Pomodoro Timer is a simple Python-based Pomodoro timer application with a graphical user interface (GUI). It helps you manage your work time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals separated by short breaks.
#Features

    Visual countdown timer with minutes and seconds displayed on the GUI.
    Audio notifications to signal the end of a Pomodoro session.
    Simple and intuitive graphical user interface.
    Easy-to-follow structure for work and break periods.

#Getting Started

To get started with the Pomodoro Timer application, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro.git

Install the required dependencies:

This application relies on some Python libraries. Make sure you have them installed: pip install tkinter playsound

Run the Pomodoro Timer:

    Navigate to the project directory.

    Execute the Python script: python pomodoro.py

    Use the Pomodoro Timer:
        Set the desired work and break intervals using the GUI.
        Click the "Start" button to begin a work session. The timer will count down.
        When the work session ends, you'll hear a sound, and a message will prompt you to take a break.
        Click the "Break" button to start your break session.
        When the break session ends, you'll hear another sound, and a message will prompt you to get back to work.

#Usage

The Pomodoro class within the pomodoro.py file handles the timer logic. You can customize the work and break durations by modifying the timer values in the work and break_ methods. Additionally, you can change the sound file by updating the playsound calls.
